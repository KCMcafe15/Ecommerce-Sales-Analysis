## About the project

The project focuses on the performance of an eCommerce business, examining key metrics like sales, profit, and quantity sold, while analyzing trends across products, regions, and time periods. It aims to identify top revenue drivers and growth opportunities to improve profitability and guide strategic decisions.

## About the dataset

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the “Ecommerce Sales Analysis.xlsx - Data”. It contains an overview of e-commerce transactions, including order details, customer information, product data, and sales metrics such as sales value, quantity, discounts, and profit. 

## Questions for the analysis
1. What are the overall sales, profit, and quantity sold, and how have they grown year-over-year?
2. How do sales and profit trends vary month by month?
3. Which product categories contribute the most to profit, and how do they compare?
4. What are the top-performing sub-categories in terms of sales?
4. How is sales performance distributed across different states and regions?

## Key takeaways
1. Sales and profit are growing (20.62% and 14.41% YOY), but the profit margin has slightly declined by 5.15%, suggesting that cost increases might be impacting profitability.
2. Sales peak in March, September, and November, likely due to seasonal demand.
3. Technology is the top-performing category, contributing approximately 145,455 in profit. Followed by Office Supplies and Furniture.
4. Phones and Chairs are the top-selling sub-categories, driving significant revenue.
5. Highest sales are in California, Texas, and New York, while states like Wyoming and Alaska show minimal sales.

## Recommendations:
1. Analyze costs to address the decline in profit margin, potentially through cost-cutting or price adjustments.
2. Plan promotions in March, September, and November to maximize sales during peak months.
3. Expand the Technology category and promote top sub-categories like Phones and Chairs.
4. Increase marketing efforts in underperforming states like Wyoming and Alaska to explore new market opportunities.
5. Strengthen marketing in high-sales states like California and Texas to deepen market share.
